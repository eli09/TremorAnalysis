# TremorAnalysis
Parsing of Parkinson's tremor data. FFT based NN classifier for tremor detection and severity scoring.

In order for the parser to work, the original data must be in folder .\Data\
For FFTNet, the folder used was .\fft_files\
Both of these folders need to be in the same folder where the .py is run.
